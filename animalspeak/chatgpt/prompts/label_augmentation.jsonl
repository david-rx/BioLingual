{"role": "user", "content": "I am doing an audio classification task where the labels are Horses_running, wind_blowing, cats meowing. For each label, I want to describe more specific variations. For example, for 'dog bark', a variation could be 'many large dogs barking in the rain.' For jackhammer, the description could be 'Jackhammer in the background in a bustling city.' Can you please list the variations? It is important that your descriptions for one class do not overlap with the other class labels, however. For example, if there are labels of car_horn and also children_playing, a description for car_horn should not be 'Car honks at running children' because the label would be ambiguous. Please generate four variations for the label 'Horses_running.' Separate variations with ||."}
