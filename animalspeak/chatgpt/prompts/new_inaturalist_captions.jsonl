{"role": "user", "content": "I have a set of audio recordings of animals where I know the species and have a short description. However, often the description doesn't actually describe what the animal is doing in the audio, it only gives context. Please help me caption the audio with a relevant caption describing audible information. If any information in the description is not something you can hear, leave it out, and respond with a caption of \"The sound of a {species name.}\" Some examples: the species \"agile gibbon\" and the description \"Agile gibbon in the distance in Tesso Nilo National Park, Sumatra.\" could have caption \"The sound of agile gibbon in the distance.\". If the species is \"banded mongoose\" and the description is \"Banded Mongoose (Mungos mungo ssp. taenianotus) taking the family, including little babies, accros the road to their overnight spot. Very social and making soft noises (first part of the clip) all the time.  The one baby did not want to leave a safe place under a plant and the adult had to persuade the little one in a more strict tone (last part of the clip).\" a good caption would be \"A family of banded mongoose making soft noises, with a stern tone at the end from the adult.\" The key is to only include auditory information in the caption. Leave out any specific countries, park names, or locations. For species \"Siamang\" and description \"Sound extracted from a GoPro video. We saw the siamang but could not get a photo.\", a good caption is \"Sound from a Siamang.\" For species 'Tule Elk' and descripition \"The recording is really faint. There's a good whistle towards the end. I was at least 1/4 mile away from the elk. Tule Elk were calling to each other and snorting.  2 males butted antlers. The elk made an interesting high pitched whistling sound. There were about a dozen.' what would be a good caption? Please reply with only the caption."}
